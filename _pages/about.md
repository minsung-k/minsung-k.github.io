Hi, I'm Minsung Kang(강민성 in Korean). I'm a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at <a href='https://www.uga.edu/'>University of Georgia</a>, advised by Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/hongyuesun/home?authuser=0'>Hongyue Sun</a>. I receved my Master's degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering, <a href='https://www.ufl.edu/'>University of Flolrida</a>, advised by Prof. <a href='https://www.ise.ufl.edu/xian/'>Xiaochen Xian</a>.

My primary research interests lie in the area of **big data analytics, machine learning and Interpretable AI**. I am particularly interested in how we can build a robust machine learning algorithm to solve real-world problems.
